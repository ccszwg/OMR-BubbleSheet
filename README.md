# OMR-BubbleSheet
This is inspired by a python tutorial on pyimagesearch.com. C++ is used instead of Python and different approaches are used to achieve the same result. Basically, this is using OpenCV to read exam BubbleSheet and mark the paper and print result (%) on the sheet. A sample output is included.
